# Serverless WorkoutBuddy

To implement this project, you need to implement a simple TODO application using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework. Search for all comments starting with the `TODO:` in the code to find the placeholders that you need to implement.

# Functionality of the application

This application will allow users to set weekly workout goals and track their achievements. User can create/remove/fetch workout activities for each day of the week. User can optionally attach an image (self or otherwise) as a motivational aid. Each user only has access to workout plan that he/she has created.
